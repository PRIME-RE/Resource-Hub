# PRIME-DRE Brainhack     
Following the GCW, there will be a short NHP-focused Brainhack held on July 28-29 (location to be announced but will be close to the GCW). This will be an excllent opportunity
for those interested in one or two more days of sharing ideas, pitching projects and hacking away in an open inclusive environment. 
     
You might make a start with some of the things discussed at the GCW, get help solving issues you've been struggling, build lasting connections, or simply hang out in a stimulating place for a bit.

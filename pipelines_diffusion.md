### Details
#### Diffusion-MRI by Rakshit
These [jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/RDadarwal/Diffusion-MRI), provided by [Rakshit Dadarwal](https://github.com/RDadarwal), showcase  an example of diffusion MRI preprocessing and analysis with python. They include steps for basic preprocessing (denoising, susceptibility-induced distortion correction, eddy current-induced distortion and motion correction), model fitting (DTI, DKI, NODDI) and calculation of parametric maps. These steps use functions from [DIPY](https://dipy.org/), [FSL](https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/), and [AMICO](https://github.com/daducci/AMICO).

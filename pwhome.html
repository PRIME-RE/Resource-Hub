	Welcome to the encrypted section of PRIME-RE. These pages are encrypted by the PRIME-RE team before pushing them to repo and are decrypted by your browser. We are using <a href="https://www.maxlaumeister.com/pagecrypt/">PageCrypt</a> to do this. The encryption key does not exist online and needs to be provided by an administrator.

<p>
	This is just a test page for now, but the encryption method allows us to share sensitive information.

# Tutorials & resources

The [PRIME-RE wiki](https://github.com/PRIME-RE/prime-re.github.io/wiki/) contains valuable information, but numerous other websites also offer nice collections of tutorials (neuroimaging, data analysis, etc) and resources. We list a few of them here as a convenient starting point. If you think we should add something to this list, [let us know](https://github.com/PRIME-RE/prime-re.github.io/issues/new?assignees=&labels=Contact&template=contact.md&title=[Contact]:%C2%A0%3Ctopic%3E).

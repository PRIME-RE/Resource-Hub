# A framework and resource for global collaboration in NHP neuroscience

### Description
As science and technology evolve, there is an increasing need for promotion of international scientific exchange. Collaborations, while offering substantial opportunities for scientists and benefit to society, also present challenges for those working with animal models, such as non-human primates (NHPs). Diversity in regulation of animal research is sometimes mistaken for the absence of common international welfare standards. Here, the ethical and regulatory protocols for 13 countries that have guidelines in place for biomedical and/or neuroscience research involving NHPs were assessed with a focus on neuroscience. Review of the variability and similarity in trans-national NHP welfare regulations extended to countries in Asia, Europe and North America. A tabulated resource is established to advance solution-oriented discussions and scientific collaborations across borders. Our aim is to better inform the public and other stakeholders. Through cooperative efforts to identify and analyze information with reference to evidence-based discussion, the proposed key ingredients may help to shape and support a more informed, open framework. This framework and resource can be expanded further for biomedical research in other countries.

##### Table 1A. Local Committees for Animal Welfare Review        
  
|Belgium    |Yes, a local animal ethics committee reviews, and provides approval for all animal protocols, including NHPs. Committee members are comprised of veterinarians, researchers, statisticians, caretakers, medical doctors, legal experts, and ethicists. Some committee members work at a university, while others are not linked to a university.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

|France     |Yes, local ethical committees (CEEA) provide an ethical evaluation of NHP project applications and a recommendation. If the Local Committee (LC) does not approve the NHP project application, the application is not forwarded for ethical evaluation at the national level. Project applications have to comply with national policy on animal research, which is issued by the national steering committee on animal research (CNREEA) and abides by national decrees relating to the ethical evaluation and the authorization of projects involving the use of animals in experimental procedures and their updates. They have to be registered to the secretary of the national steering committee on animal research (CNREEA), hosted by the Ministry of Higher Education, Research and Innovation. They commit to operate in a transparent and independent manner, to render their judgment with complete impartiality and to guarantee confidentiality. LCs are, at minimum, comprised of a veterinary, a scientist involved in animal research (NHP research when relevant), a technician involved in animal research (NHP research when relevant), an animal caregiver, and a lay person naïve to animal research. Eight to 10 people usually serve on a LC.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

|Netherlands|Yes, the institutional Animal Welfare Body (IvD) is the first committee to review an application. The IvD members are animal welfare officers, technicians, and other scientists. The IvD’s official duties are to: Advise staff who deal with animals on animal welfare issues; Advise staff on the 3Rs and on related technical and scientific developments; Establish and review internal procedures; Monitor the development and outcome of projects; Advise on possible adoption schemes. If the IvD supports an application, they advise an Animal Ethics Committee (DEC) on their independent review of the application. It is the DEC that ultimately advises the national ethics committee (Central Authority for Scientific Procedures on Animals: CCD) which decides whether a license will be granted. In their advisory reports to the CCD, DECs use criteria that are set out in legislation. There are currently about 25 DECs in the Netherlands. These are affiliated with the Netherlands Association of Animal Ethics Committees (NVDEC). A DEC consists of at least seven members, with expertise in the various areas of scientific disciplines and scientific applications for which the animals are to be used. This includes Replacement, Reduction and Refinement (3Rs) in these fields; Experimental design (including statistical aspects); The practice of laboratory animal medicine or, where necessary, veterinary practice with wild animals; Keeping, caring for, and treating animals of those species that are to be used; Ethics; Laboratory animals and their protection. At least two members are not professionally involved in animal procedures.

There is often a clear deficit in understanding the principles of working with primates.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
|UK         |Yes, the local animal welfare and ethical review committee (AWERB) at each institution (e.g. universities, contract research organisations, and NHP breeding centre) provides an ethical evaluation of the NHP project applications and a recommendation. If the AWERB does not approve a NHP project application, the application is not forwarded to the next stage. LCs are, at minimum, comprised of a Named Veterinarian Surgeon (NVS), Named Animal Welfare and Care Officer (NACWO), a scientist involved in animal research (NHP research when relevant), Establishment Licence Holder from the institution, a secretary, and public representatives (lay persons). Between 8-12 people usually serve on an AWERB. In the UK, all project licences authorising scientific research involving animals come under the Animal (Scientific) Procedures Act, 1986 and EU Directive 2010/EU/63. The Secretary of State at the UK Home Office provides authorization of the regulated procedures carried out on animals. The project licence is a legally binding document.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

|India      |Yes, for carrying out the experiment on NHPs, approval of the Committee for the Purpose of Control and Supervision of Experiments on Animals (CPCSEA) is a must and IAEC may only recommend the research protocol for consideration by CPCSEA. CPCSEA is a statutory body under the PCA (Prevention of Cruelty to Animals) Act 1960 and Breeding of and Experiments on Animals (Control and Supervision) Rules, 1998, Government of India. This body consists of nominated members and representatives from national regulatory agencies, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Ministry of Environment and Forests, national academic and research councils, premier research institutes, eminent scientists, and animal welfare organizations. The duty of the committee is "to take all such measures as may be necessary to ensure that animals are not subject to unnecessary pain or suffering before, during or after the performance of experiments on them." Investigators whose proposals are to be discussed are called to present their case to the IAEC/CPCSEA approval committee to offer clarifications, if needed. Independent consultants/experts will be invited to offer their opinion on specific research proposals, if needed.|

|USA        |No, given the considerable expenses involved NHP research is typically funded by a federal agency. As part of the application, a section on vertebrate animals has to be filed, which contains all relevant information on the procedures that the laboratory animals will undergo. The review panel discusses this section along with the application. If the procedures detailed in the application do not meet ethical standards, it will not get funded. Approval by the local IACUC is necessary in order to receive federal support.                                            |  
  
##### Table 1D. Implementation of the 3Rs (Replacement, Reduction, Refinement)     

|Belgium    |Yes, each project should be in accordance with the National Institute of Health (NIH) Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and the European guidelines (Directive 2010/63/EU). Experimenters have to prove adequate training and the 3R's have to be considered in each protocol. The necessity of using NHPs compared to other animal species and humans has to be shown. The number of proposed animals has to be justified. The origin of the animals has to be shown (at least second generation bred by authorized NHP breeders). NHP projects have to follow the recommendations of the Weatherall Report, and animals need to be allowed extensive locomotor behavior, foraging, and social interactions. The intended treatment and care (including housing) before, during and after the procedure, as well as the expertise of the responsible individuals is considered. The nature, frequency and duration of the procedures to which the animal is to be subjected as well as the degree of distress/discomfort that the laboratory animals will (or may) experience. The use (or potential use) of anaesthesia or analgesics and other methods to avoid distress/discomfort and whether a given animal was previously used for a procedure. Additionally, whether, and – if so – at what time, it was decided to proceed with the responsible sacrifice of the laboratory animals involved and the method used on that occasion.

|Germany    |Yes, under the European Directive 2010/63EU, researchers must replace animal studies with other research methods wherever possible; employ strategies that will reduce the number of animals as far as possible while maintaining scientific rigor; and refine experimental and husbandry procedures to minimize potential pain or distress for the animals. Better animal welfare improves the quality of science, and special protections are provided to NHPs to ensure that they can only be used if the researchers first show why they cannot use another species instead.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|India      |Yes, IAEC and CPCSEA ensure the concept of 3Rs/4Rs (replacement, reduction, refinement, and rehabilitation; in case of experimentation involving large animals) which are aimed at minimizing the welfare costs to animals used in research. Animals lowest on the phylogenetic scale (i.e., with the least degree of sentience), which may give scientifically valid results, should be used for any experimental procedure. Experiments are expected to be designed with the minimum number of animals to give statistically valid results at 95% level of confidence. Alternatives not involving animal testing should be given due and full consideration and sound justification provided, if alternatives, when available, are not used. PIs engaged in animal experimentation have a moral responsibility for the welfare of the animals during, after their use in experiments. Investigators are responsible for the aftercare and/or rehabilitation of animals after experimentation and may be permitted to euthanize in the special circumstances mentioned in the CPCSEA guideline. Costs of aftercare and/or rehabilitation of animal’s post-experimentation are to be part of research costs and should be scaled per animal in positive correlation with the level of sentience of the animals. Nominee can visit and check the animal house without the prior intimation at any times whenever possible to ensure the welfare of animals.                                                                            |
|Iran       |Yes, the PI must complete a research protocol that contains model selections and 3Rs concerns. The PI should provide enough evidence from the literature to show the significance of research and the necessity of animal selection. All engaged researchers should take regular training workshops on working with the animal.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

|Netherlands|Yes, the CCD & DEC examine various points of the project plan: The expertise of the individual who determines the design and implementation of the procedure. By whom, or by which committee, the procedure’s scientific quality is assessed. The reasoning used to answer the question of why the procedure could not be performed with fewer laboratory animals, or by using a technique that did not involve the use of laboratory animals at all (3Rs). The reasons given for selecting the species and number of laboratory animals to be used. The origin of the laboratory animals to be used. The intended treatment and care (including housing) before, during and after the procedure, as well as the expertise of the responsible individuals. The nature, frequency and duration of the procedures to which the animal is to be subjected. The degree of distress/discomfort that the laboratory animals will (or may) experience. The use (or potential use) of anaesthesia or analgesics and other methods to avoid distress/discomfort. Whether a given animal was previously used for a procedure. Whether, and – if so – at what time, it was decided to proceed with the responsible sacrifice of the laboratory animals involved and the method used on that occasion. The final destination of the animal after the procedure.                                                                                                                                                                                   |

|UK         |Regular meetings with the NVS and NACWO are held to ensure project is on course and if any changes have to be implemented. May need protocol and procedure changes to project licence. These changes require approval from AWERB, and sometimes ASC. They also require authorization from HOI and sign off from Home Office Secretary of State. AWERB is also responsible for the retrospective analysis half way through the project (typically at the two-year stage) and at the end of the project. These retrospective reviews are then submitted to the Home Office. The regional HOI will undertake regular, unannounced visits and may access any records, if requested [more info](https://www.health-ni.gov.uk/publications/animal-scientific-procedures-retrospective-assessment-guidance).                   |

|China      |The procedures that can be considered ‘harmful’ are surgery, anesthesia, housing, and water regulation. To weigh the harms and benefits, specific questions are asked. Do surgical anesthesia and analgesia procedures follow NIH regulations? What defines the study endpoint? If housed singly, what are the considerations of social benefit vs. injury due to fighting. For water regulation, what is the minimum volume per day, and how is animal health monitored? What kinds of enrichment is provided (e.g. foods, toys, TV, tasks related to study goals, time in a larger play cage). Sometimes the value of the proposed research and whether the same work can be done in a different species is additionally discussed.                                                                                                                         |

|India      |The Principle Investigator (PI) must ensure that the procedures, which are considered painful, are conducted under appropriate anaesthesia and analgesia as recommended in the CPCSEA guideline. Rationale for animal usage will be discussed during the IAEC meeting with the following points: a. Why is animal usage necessary for these studies? b. Why are the particular species that are selected required? c. Why is the estimated number of animals essential? d. Are similar experiments conducted in the past? If so, the number of animals used and results obtained in brief. e. If yes, why new experiment is required? f. Have similar experiments been made by any other organization agency?

Our routine laboratory procedures include housing the primates in a large space with sunshine, providing them with a psychological enriched environment (TV and toys), frequent contact with other animals (visual, auditory, touch and grooming).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
|Japan      |The validity of an animal experiment is judged by a harm/benefit analysis of pain/distress experienced by animals and the significance (outcome) of the experiment. Depending on the nature of the research being conducted, the degree of pain/distress experienced by animals is grouped into 5 categories. When preparing an animal experiment protocol, the principal investigator must fully understand which pain category the protocol falls into.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

|USA        |Animal research in the US is governed by Federal legislation – the Animal Welfare Act and the enforcement branch of the USDA, called APHIS, oversees animal use and research. Biomedical research funded by the NIH and NSF, or DOD, is under additional regulations as outlined by the PHS of NIH and the enforcement branch OLAW. FDA also provides oversight for its supported research. AAALAC International is a private, non-profit organization that promotes the humane treatment of animals used in scientific research. AAALAC standards exceed those of federal laws and policies, and accreditation by AAALAC International is a clear demonstration of an institution's commitment to the responsible treatment of animals. Many US institutions are AAALAC accredited.|

|Netherlands|Allowed. By an absolute  minimum of 100 mL/day and a minimum average of 35 mg/kg  (metabolic weight)/day over the last 3 days. Metabolic weight is weight in kilograms raised to the power of 0.75. It more accurately reflects the monkey’s fluid requirements as heavier monkeys require proportionately less water than lighter monkeys; e.g., a 10 kg animal must, on average, receive a minimum of: 10^0.75 x 35 = 197 mL of fluid per day. If this amount is not reached during the training session, it is supplemented. These numbers are based on recommendations by the British N3CR (National Centre for the Replacement, Refinement, and Reduction of Animals in Research; Prescott et al., 2010) and the primate facility of UC Davis (2001, USA). It is a minimum amount and the animals typically receive much more fluid than this. Fluid intake, both received during training and supplemented in the cage, is monitored daily and logged in an electronic system accessible by researchers, caretakers and inspectors. The animal is provided with fruit after the training session, the liquid content of the fruit is not counted towards the minimum amount. During breaks in the training schedule of more than one day (e.g., weekends), the monkey receives a full water bottle of at least 700 mL, animals over 15 kg receive an extra bottle. If the break is only one day, then the animal receives an amount of fluid equal to what it would typically receive during a training session. While the animal is under fluid control, the researchers and animal caretakers monitor its appearance and behavior carefully every day, with checks by the animal caretakers during the weekend. We weigh the monkey before and after training and compare the weight to the average weight during the previous week. The weight is also checked over longer intervals to prevent a slow loss of weight. We check the monkey for any signs of dehydration, such as reduced skin tension, sunken eyes, either increased or reduced activity, and dry feces. If any of these welfare criteria is abnormal, the monkey is taken out of training and provided with ad libitum access to fluid until it has recovered. In that case, the Animal Welfare Body will be informed so that they can check on the animal. This has not happened in the previous 10 years. These criteria (weight, fluid consumed per day) are logged in an electronic system for each monkey so that the history is accessible. The animal receives a non-working period once every 9 weeks (on average over a year). During this period the animal is not trained and receives a full bottle each day (>700 mL).

|India      |Behavioural and neurophysiology experiments on NHPs are very limited in India and currently only performed at the Primate Research Lab (PRL), Indian Institute of Science (IISc). Therefore, for some of these questions, explicit guidelines are not available from CPCSEA. In such cases, we have followed the guidelines recommended by the funding agencies, such as DBT-Wellcome Trust India Alliance (who recommend the UK guidelines) and NIH (US guidelines). Euthanasia: Every effort is made to rehabilitate, and in PRL, we have been able to rehabilitate most of the animals so far. Monkeys can be used again (to record from the other hemisphere if needed). The total duration is up to 5 years, including training, etc. Animal euthanasia is followed in situations as defined below: (i) When the animal is paralyzed and is not able to perform its natural functions or it becomes incapable of independent locomotion, or it can no longer perceive the environment in an intelligible manner; or (ii) If, during the course of experimental procedure, the animal has been left with a recurring pain wherein the animal exhibits obvious signs of pain and suffering; or (iii) Where the non-termination of the life of the experimental animal will be life threatening to human beings or other animals. The veterinarian has the authority to euthanize the animal in consultation with at least one more additional veterinarian if required, following diagnosis of an animal disease or injury. If possible, the veterinarian should discuss the situation with the PI to determine a course of action consistent with experimental goals.|

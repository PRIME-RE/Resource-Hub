## E. Communication
Link to the communication channel for your project. You can, for example, create a [slack channel](https://brainhack-slack-invite.herokuapp.com/) for your project inside the Brainhack slack community, and include a slack badge [![slack_brainhack_3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6297454/47951457-5b37b780-df61-11e8-9d77-7b5a4c7af875.png)](https://brainhack-slack-invite.herokuapp.com/) to invite people to Brainhack slack, where they can then find and join your channel.  
Or create a community on [gitter](https://gitter.im/) and link to the chat by including a Gitter badge linking to your community

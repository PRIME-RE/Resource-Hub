# PRIME-DRE GCW 2024 
We are proud to announce the 2024 **PRIMatE Data and Resource Exchange (PRIME-DRE) Global Collaboration Workshop (GCW)**. This year’s workshop will take place online on December 3-4, 2024 (9:00AM-1:30PM EST). 

The recently installed Steering Committee has chosen to focus this meeting on getting to know each other, our science, and initiatives with a similar scope as PRIME-DRE. We again aim to offer a place to start thinking about collaborative projects and bring together scientists from across the world. The program will be listed here after it has been finalized, but as in previous GCWs, there will be two breakout sessions and general discussions on the following topics:

**Topic A: Bottom-up approaches to creating multimodal functional connectomes**    
Leaders: Chris Klink, Amir Shmuel, Igor Kagan      

**Topic B: Large-scale lifespan studies**    
Leaders: Alison Weiss, Ting Xu, Katja Heuer      

# Flash talks     
Both days will feature a flash talk session in which PRIME-DRE consortium members of all career stages will briefly present themselves and their scientific interests to the community.

# Similar initiatives and funding agencies    
There will be brief introductory presentations from initiatives that are similar to PRIME-DRE and we might learn from or connect with, as well from funding agencies to hear about the possibilities for PRIME-DRE related funding schemes.

# Pre-Workshop Videoconference Schedule
Following the model of previous meetings, there will be a few pre-workshop videoconferences to help get the conversations going prior to the workshop on December 3-4. This process is intended to facilitate more mature dialogues and brainstorming sessions at the in-person meeting.

Below is the pre-workshop schedule for each of the Topic Areas, which was based on the mutual availability of Topic Area co-leaders and advisors. Please feel free to join as many videoconferences as you would like – everyone’s participation is encouraged!

### Topic A: Bottom-up approaches towards multimodal functional connectomes      
5 November, 11 PM EST       
20 November, 11 PM EST         

### Topic B: Large-scale lifespan studies     
8 November, 12 PM EST

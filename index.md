# PRIME-RE
Welcome to PRIME-RE, the primary exchange platform for resources related to non-human primate neuroimaging data.    

![logo](images/social_preview_image.png)

The preprocessing and analysis of nonhuman primate (NHP) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data presents some unique challenges. Over the years, many laboratories and researchers have created their own custom solutions to many of these problems. PRIME-RE aims to provide an overview of the main difficulties and curate a collection of solutions that currently exist within the broader NHP-MRI community for specific processing steps that are commonly performed on NHP MRI data. Since this is a community effort, we strongly encourage you to contribute your workflows and pipelines. 

PRIME-RE is maintained by members of the [PRIME-DE consortium](http://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/indiPRIME.html). 

### How to contribute ?
Send new content by using [this issue template](https://github.com/PRIME-RE/prime-re.github.io/issues/new?assignees=&labels=new-resource&template=new-resource.md&title=%3CResource+Name%3E). You can also join our communication channel around the Primate Data Exchange on the Brainhack community on [PRIME-DE Mattermost-channel](https://mattermost.brainhack.org/brainhack/channels/prime-de) or specifically for this Primate Resource Exchange via on [PRIME-RE Mattermost-channel](https://mattermost.brainhack.org/brainhack/channels/compmri_resourcehub) .

### Wiki
A [wiki](https://github.com/PRIME-RE/prime-re.github.io/wiki/Structural-preprocessing) have been set up to share knowledge about NHP MRI acquisition and image processing. Anyone can share knowledge and experience (problems with solutions, fixes, tricks...).

### Resources
The PRIME-RE collection of resources is organized in several categories. If you feel like something is missing or erroneously categorized, don't hesitate to contact us. We make a disctinction between 'Pipelines' (custom written analysis solutions) and 'Software packages' (complete software solutions, many of which may appear in the pipelines)   

- [Templates and Atlases](templates_and_atlases.md)
- [Versatile tools](versatile_tools.md)
- Pipelines
    - [Structural](pipelines_structural.md)
    - [fMRI](pipelines_fmri.md)
    - [Diffusion](pipelines_diffusion.md)
- [Software packages](software_packages.md)

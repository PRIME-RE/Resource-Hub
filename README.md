## Welcome to PRIME-RE
### The PRIMatE Research Exchange

The preprocessing and analysis of nonhuman primate (NHP) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data presents some unique challenges.
PRIME-RE aims to provide a description of the main difficulties and the existing solutions associated with each of the processing steps commonly performed on NHP MRI data.
PRIME-RE is maintained and curated by members of the [PRIME-DE consortium](http://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/indiPRIME.html).
